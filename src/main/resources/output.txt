Explanation:
- InputStreamReader: Wraps a FileInputStream and reads bytes from a file, converting them into characters using the specified character encoding (UTF-8 in this case).
- OutputStreamWriter: Wraps a FileOutputStream and writes characters to a file, converting them back into bytes using the specified encoding.
 + The try-with-resources statement ensures that the streams are closed automatically after use.
Input/Output Files:
- The input.txt file is the source file containing the data.
- The output.txt file is the destination where the data will be written.
