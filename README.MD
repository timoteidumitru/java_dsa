## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of key data structures and algorithms in Java, accompanied by explanations and example usage.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timoteidumitru/java_dsa.git
cd java_dsa
```

## Data Structures
### Stack
- Array-based Stack: A stack using a dynamic array with methods for common operations.
- Linked List-based Stack: A stack implemented with a singly linked list for dynamic memory management.
### Linked Lists
  - Singly Linked List: Basic structure where each node points to the next. Includes insertion, deletion, and search.
  - Doubly Linked List: Nodes have references to both next and previous nodes, allowing efficient bidirectional traversal.
  - Algorithms Binary Search
  Efficiently finds an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval.

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Selection Sort: Selects the smallest element from an unsorted list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
